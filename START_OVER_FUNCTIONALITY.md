# Start Over Functionality

## Overview

The "Start Over" functionality allows logged-in users to reset their entire matching history, clearing all their matches and swipes. This enables users to start fresh and rematch with all available stylists.

## How It Works

### 1. User Interface
- **Swipe Page**: A "Start Over" button is available in the top-right corner
- **Matches Page**: A "Start Over" button is available below the page title
- **No Matches State**: When there are no matches, a "Start Over" button is also available

### 2. Functionality
When a user clicks "Start Over":

1. **Confirmation Dialog**: A confirmation dialog appears asking the user to confirm the action
2. **Database Cleanup**: 
   - All records in the `swipes` table for the user are deleted
   - All records in the `matches` table for the user are deleted
3. **UI Reset**: 
   - The current index is reset to 0
   - The stylists list is refreshed to show all available stylists
   - Success message is displayed
4. **Matches Page Update**: The matches page will show no matches after the reset

### 3. User Experience

#### Before Reset:
- User has matches and swipes
- Matches page shows matched stylists
- Swipe page shows filtered stylists (excluding already swiped/matched)

#### After Reset:
- All matches and swipes are cleared
- User can see all stylists again
- Matches page shows "No matches yet" message
- Success message confirms the reset

## Implementation Details

### Database Operations
```sql
-- Delete all swipes for the user
DELETE FROM swipes WHERE user_id = 'user_id';

-- Delete all matches for the user  
DELETE FROM matches WHERE user_id = 'user_id';
```

### Frontend Components

#### Swipe Page (`app/swipe/page.tsx`)
- `handleStartOver()` function handles the reset logic
- Success message overlay shows confirmation
- "Matches" button added to navigation
- Current index reset to 0

#### Matches Page (`app/matches/page.tsx`)
- "Start Over" button in header
- "Start Over" button in no-matches state
- Automatic page refresh after reset

### Error Handling
- Database operation errors are caught and displayed
- User confirmation prevents accidental resets
- Loading states during reset operations

## Testing

Use the `test-start-over.js` script to verify the functionality:

```bash
node test-start-over.js
```

**Note**: Replace `'your-test-user-id'` with an actual user ID before running the test.

## User Flow

1. **Logged-in user** visits the swipe page
2. **User swipes** on some stylists and gets matches
3. **User clicks "Start Over"** button
4. **Confirmation dialog** appears
5. **User confirms** the action
6. **Database cleanup** occurs
7. **Success message** is shown
8. **User can now swipe** on all stylists again
9. **Matches page** shows no matches

## Benefits

- **Fresh Start**: Users can reset their preferences and start over
- **Complete Reset**: All history is cleared, not just hidden
- **User Control**: Users have full control over their matching history
- **Clear Feedback**: Success messages and confirmations guide the user
- **Consistent UI**: Reset functionality available from multiple pages

## Security Considerations

- Only logged-in users can access the reset functionality
- User can only reset their own data (filtered by user_id)
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental resets
- Database operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks

## Future Enhancements

- **Partial Reset**: Allow users to reset only matches or only swipes
- **Reset History**: Track when resets occurred for analytics
- **Backup**: Option to backup matches before reset
- **Undo**: Temporary undo functionality for recent resets
