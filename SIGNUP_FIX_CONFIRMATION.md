## Technical Details

### Root Cause

The root cause of the "Database error saving new user" issue was:

1. Missing or incorrectly configured database triggers that should automatically create user_profiles and user_preferences records when a new user is created
2. Potential issues with the SQL script execution permissions

### Applied Fix

The fix involved:

1. Checking for the existence of required tables
2. Adding the `gender` column to `user_preferences` if it didn't exist
3. Dropping and recreating the necessary functions and triggers with proper error handling
4. Setting appropriate security contexts for the functions

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the application for any recurrence of the issue
2. Consider implementing additional error handling in the application code
3. Document the database schema and trigger system for future reference

## Verification Scripts

The following scripts were used to verify the fix:

- `verify-signup-fix.js` - Checks for table existence and attempts to create a test user
- `test-signup-functionality.js` - Comprehensive test of the signup flow

## Conclusion

The signup functionality is now working correctly. Users can register and have their profiles and preferences automatically created in the database.
