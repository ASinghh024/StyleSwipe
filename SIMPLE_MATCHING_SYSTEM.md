# Simple One-Way Matching System

## Overview
The matching system is designed to be one-way where users choose stylists, and stylists can only view their matches without accepting or declining them.

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **User swipes right** on a stylist → Creates a match
2. **Match is immediately created** and stored in the database
3. **User can see their matches** in the matches page
4. **Stylist sees the match** in their dashboard

### Stylist Flow:
1. **View matches** in the stylist dashboard
2. **See user preferences** for each match (gender, style, budget, etc.)
3. **Contact clients** who have matched with them
4. **No accept/decline required** - all matches are automatically valid

## Database Structure

### Matches Table (Simplified)
```sql
CREATE TABLE matches (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  stylist_id UUID REFERENCES stylists(id),
  matched_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, stylist_id)
);
```

### Key Features:
- ✅ **Simple structure** - No complex status tracking
- ✅ **Bidirectional visibility** - Both users and stylists can see matches
- ✅ **User preferences display** - Stylists see detailed user info
- ✅ **One-way decision** - Only users decide to match
- ✅ **Immediate matches** - No waiting for stylist approval

## Components Updated

### 1. Stylist Dashboard (`/stylist-dashboard`)
- **Match Statistics**: Shows total number of matches
- **User Information**: Displays user preferences for each match
- **Contact Button**: Simple contact action for each client
- **No Accept/Decline**: Stylists can't reject matches

### 2. User Matches Page (`/matches`)
- **Simple Status**: Shows "Matched!" for all matches
- **No Status Tracking**: No pending/mutual/declined states
- **Clean Interface**: Focus on connecting with stylists

### 3. Swipe Functionality (`/swipe`)
- **Direct Match Creation**: Right swipe immediately creates match
- **No Complex Data**: Simple match record with basic info
- **Instant Feedback**: User knows immediately they've matched
