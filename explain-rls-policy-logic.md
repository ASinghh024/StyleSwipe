# How RLS Policies Enable Stylist Dashboard Access

## 🔍 **Policy Logic Explanation**

When you apply the RLS policies, here's exactly what happens:

### **Current Situation:**
- **Stylist ID**: `99333eb6-5e87-4955-9069-e108ca40df75` (Manish M)
- **Matched User ID**: `ef8455c4-6ce7-4a94-bf84-7c1a15abb22f`
- **Match Record**: Links these two IDs in `matches` table

### **Without RLS Policies (Current Problem):**
```sql
-- This query fails because RLS blocks access
SELECT * FROM user_profiles 
WHERE user_id = 'ef8455c4-6ce7-4a94-bf84-7c1a15abb22f';
-- Result: 0 rows (blocked by RLS)
```

### **With RLS Policies (After Fix):**
```sql
-- This policy gets applied automatically:
CREATE POLICY "Stylists can view matched user profiles" ON user_profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT stylist_id FROM matches WHERE user_id = user_profiles.user_id
    )
  );
```

## 🎯 **Step-by-Step Policy Execution**

When the stylist dashboard queries `user_profiles`:

### **Step 1: Dashboard Query**
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_profiles 
WHERE user_id = 'ef8455c4-6ce7-4a94-bf84-7c1a15abb22f';
```

### **Step 2: RLS Policy Check**
PostgreSQL automatically runs this check:
```sql
-- Is the current user (stylist) allowed to see this user_profiles record?
-- auth.uid() = '99333eb6-5e87-4955-9069-e108ca40df75' (Manish M)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM matches 
WHERE user_id = 'ef8455c4-6ce7-4a94-bf84-7c1a15abb22f' 
  AND stylist_id = '99333eb6-5e87-4955-9069-e108ca40df75';
```

### **Step 3: Policy Result**
- ✅ **Match found**: Policy allows access
- ❌ **No match**: Policy blocks access

## 🚀 **What Changes After Policy Update**

### **Before (Current State):**
```
Dashboard Query → RLS Blocks → 0 results → "User abb22f" + "No preferences"
```

### **After (With Correct Policies):**
```
Dashboard Query → RLS Allows → 1 result → "Real Name" + "Full Preferences"
```

## 🔧 **Exact Query Flow After Fix**

1. **Matches Query**: ✅ Works (finds 1 match)
2. **User Profiles Query**: ✅ Now works (RLS allows access)
3. **User Preferences Query**: ✅ Now works (RLS allows access)
4. **Dashboard Display**: ✅ Shows real data

## 📊 **Expected Dashboard Result**

Instead of:
```
User abb22f
Matched 29/7/2025
No Styling Preferences Set
```

You'll see:
```
👤 [Real User Name from user_profiles]
📅 Matched 29/7/2025
🎯 Preferences:
   Gender: [from user_preferences.gender]
   Style: [from user_preferences.style_preferences]  
   Budget: [from user_preferences.budget_range]
   Clothing: [from user_preferences.clothing_preferences]
   Occasions: [from user_preferences.preferred_occasions]
```

## ✅ **Policy Security**

The policies are secure because:
- ✅ Stylists can **ONLY** see users they've matched with
- ❌ Stylists **CANNOT** see random users
- ✅ Users can **ONLY** see their own data
- ✅ Data access is **automatically controlled** by match relationships

## 🎯 **Verification Steps**

After applying the policies, you can verify they work:

1. **Check Policy Exists**:
```sql
SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'user_profiles' 
  AND policyname = 'Stylists can view matched user profiles';
```

2. **Test Access** (run as signed-in stylist):
```sql
SELECT user_id, full_name FROM user_profiles 
WHERE user_id = 'ef8455c4-6ce7-4a94-bf84-7c1a15abb22f';
```

3. **Should Return**: 1 row with the user's real name

## 🏁 **Bottom Line**

**Yes!** After updating the RLS policies:
- ✅ The dashboard **WILL** get the matched user data
- ✅ User names **WILL** show instead of "User abb22f"  
- ✅ Preferences **WILL** display instead of "No Styling Preferences Set"
- ✅ Everything **WILL** work as designed

The policies create a secure bridge that allows stylists to see **only** their matched users' data.
